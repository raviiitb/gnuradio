The scrambler works by XORing the incoming bit stream by the output of the LFSR. Optionally, after 'count' bits have been processed, the shift register is reset to the seed value. This allows processing fixed length vectors of samples.

Args:
    mask : Polynomial mask for LFSR
    seed : Initial shift register contents
    len : Shift register length
    count : Number of bits after which shift register is reset, 0=never"

%feature("docstring") gri_lfsr "Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register using specified polynomial mask

Generates a maximal length pseudo-random sequence of length 2^degree-1.

Constructor: gri_lfsr(int mask, int seed, int reg_len);

mask - polynomial coefficients representing the locations of feedback taps from a shift register which are xor'ed together to form the new high order bit.

Some common masks might be: x^4 + x^3 + x^0 = 0x19 x^5 + x^3 + x^0 = 0x29 x^6 + x^5 + x^0 = 0x61

seed - the initialization vector placed into the register durring initialization. Low order bit corresponds to x^0 coefficient -- the first to be shifted as output.

reg_len - specifies the length of the feedback shift register to be used. Durring each iteration, the register is rightshifted one and the new bit is placed in bit reg_len. reg_len should generally be at least order(mask) + 1

see  for more explanation.

next_bit() - Standard LFSR operation

Perform one cycle of the LFSR. The output bit is taken from the shift register LSB. The shift register MSB is assigned from the modulo 2 sum of the masked shift register.

next_bit_scramble(unsigned char input) - Scramble an input stream

Perform one cycle of the LFSR. The output bit is taken from the shift register LSB. The shift register MSB is assigned from the modulo 2 sum of the masked shift register and the input LSB.

next_bit_descramble(unsigned char input) - Descramble an input stream

Perform one cycle of the LFSR. The output bit is taken from the modulo 2 sum of the masked shift register and the input LSB. The shift register MSB is assigned from the LSB of the input.

See  for operation of these last two functions (see multiplicative scrambler.)"
