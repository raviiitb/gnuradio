%feature("docstring") qtgui_sink_c "A graphical sink to display freq, spec, time, and const plots.

This is a QT-based graphical sink the takes a complex stream and plots it. The default action is to plot the signal as a PSD (FFT), spectrogram (waterfall), time domain I&Q, and constellation (I vs. Q) plots. The plots may be turned off by setting the appropriate boolean value in the constructor to False."

%feature("docstring") qtgui_time_sink_c "A graphical sink to display multiple signals in time.

This is a QT-based graphical sink the takes set of a complex streams and plots them in the time domain. For each signal, both the signal's I and Q parts are plotted, and they are all plotted with a different color, and the  and  functions can be used to change the lable and color for a given input number."
